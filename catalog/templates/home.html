      <h2>Our Model</h2>
      <p>
        For All Counseling aims to increase access to mental health evaluations
        for people going through immigration and asylum proceedings despite
        language, location, or ability to pay. We also aim to pay clinicians a
        fair market rate to create a sustainable model where both clients and
        clinicians feel valued. We use funding from individual donors and grants
        to offset the cost of our subsidized evaluations.
